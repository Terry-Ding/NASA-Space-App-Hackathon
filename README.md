## üåç Overview

On a 3-year Mars mission, an 8-person crew generates over **12,000 kg** of inorganic waste.  
**Project Aurax** solves this with the **Mars Habitat Recycling-to-Manufacturing System (MHRMS)**‚Äîa modular, grid-powered system that recycles carbon, plastics, metals, fabrics, and composites into:

- 3D-printable filament  
- Tools, habitat parts, and life-support components  
- Propellant gases (O‚ÇÇ/CH‚ÇÑ)  
- Radiation shielding and filters  

The system is supported by a fleet of **7 specialized Mars rovers** for autonomous collection, transport, and maintenance.
