\section{Problem Definition}

\subsection{Need Statement}
During a three-year mission, an eight-person crew would accumulate over 12,000 kg of inorganic waste, or trash, which is a huge problem. If the issue is not addressed as soon as possible, we humans might cause some permanent damage to the environment on Mars.

\subsection{Goal}
Find an efficient and reliable way to recycle and reuse the waste on Mars.

\subsection{Objectives}
