\section{Problem Definition}

\subsection{Need Statement}
During a three-year mission, an eight-person crew would accumulate over 12,000 kg of inorganic waste, or trash, which is a huge problem. If the issue is not addressed as soon as possible, we humans might cause some permanent damage to the environment on Mars.

\subsection{Goal}
Find an efficient and reliable way to recycle and reuse the waste on Mars.

\subsection{Objectives}

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solutions must be completed within one week.
    \item Solutions must not burn anything without proper collection on Mars.
    \item Solutions must not cost too much money.
    \item Solutions must not be too complicated to implement.
\end{itemize}

\section{Our Solution}
Mars Habitat Recycling-to-Manufacturing System (MHRMS)
\subsection{Purpose}
This system is designed to convert waste materials from
Mars habitat operations into usable 3D printing filament and
manufacturing feedstock, with emphasis on CO2 extraction 
byproducts. 

\subsection{Design Philofophy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Modular
    \item relocatable
    \item powered by habitat frid
    \item zero-waste discharge
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mars Environment Context}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases, with temperatures ranging from 70°F (20°C) to -225°F (-153°C)
    \item Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by meteorites and the thin atmosphere causes heat from the Sun to easily escape
    \item Dust storms can cover much of the planet, sometimes taking months for all dust to settle
    \item Mars completes one rotation every 24.6 hours (a "sol"), with a year lasting 687 Earth days
    \item These conditions directly impact recycling system design: thermal management is critical, dust mitigation essential
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design Considerations}
Waste behavior in Mars Environment
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Vacuum Exposure Challenges: Based on NASA Glenn Research Center analysis of waste behavior when exposed to vacuum
    \item Water Sublimation: When waste is exposed to Mars' near-vacuum conditions (0.6\% Earth pressure), approximately 20\% of water content will sublimate before the waste completely freezes. This process takes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Small items (3mm droplets): ~7 seconds to freeze
        \item Standard waste "football" (20cm compressed bundle): ~3.4 hours to freeze
    \end{itemize}
    \item Implications for recycling system:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Pre-processing must handle both frozen and partially sublimated materials
        \item Vapor capture systems required to prevent water loss during initial processing
        \item Grinding chambers must be sealed to capture sublimating volatiles
        \item Temperature control critical: waste arriving at facility may be frozen solid (-153°C from overnight exposure)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Thermal management on mars
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Challenge: Mars temperature swings from 70°F (20°C) to -225°F (-153°C)
        \item Solution:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Insulated processing chambers: Maintain optimal processing temperatures (150-1400°C depending on module)
            \item Pre-heating systems: Thaw frozen waste before processing
            \item Waste heat recovery: Capture heat from processing for habitat use
            \item Phase-change thermal buffers: Smooth out temperature fluctuations
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Mars sol adaptation
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mars day: 24.6 hours VS Earth's 24 hours
        \item Operational impact:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Processing schedules calibrated to Mars sols
            \item Automation advantage: rovers and processing continue during crew sleep cycles
            \item Benefit: Extra 39 minutes per sol allows for extended processing cycles
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
