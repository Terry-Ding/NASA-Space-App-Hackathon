# Special Controlled Environment Habitat

## Mission & Design Philosophy
1. Mission:
   1. dedicated and fully controlled 
   2. demonstrate autonomous with high operational efficiency, safety, and minimal crew involvement
   3. reuse the waste on Mars
2. Goals:
   1. zero emission and sustainable
   2. maximize the usage of the waste on Mars
   3. integrated habitat electrical grid powered
   4. highly reliable and maintainable with minimal crew intervention

## Rover Integration
1. Fleet docking bays designed with:
   1. automated charing interface
   2. material transfer ports to store pods
   3. pathways for autonomous navigation within habitat
2. Rover types supported:
   1. carbon collector
   2. polymer/plastic collector
   3. metal collector

## Workflow (autonomous & modular)
1. Material Collection: 
   - Rovers gather materials outside --> dock --> deposit into stage pods
2. Material Sorting:
   - Automated conveyors/robotic arms sort materials by category
   - pre-processing: grinding, drying, and shredding
3. Processing:
   - Modules 1-3 handle carbon, polymer/fabric, metal processing
   - Filament/power production and quality control
4. Manufacturing:
   - Module 4 prints finished products: tools, replacement parts, habitat components
   - CNC finishing ensures tolerance adherence 
5. Rover Maintenance: 
   - Maintenance/inspection rovers handle minor repairs
   - Automated monitoring detects anomalies
6. Future Additions:
   - New processing modules, advanced manufacturing tech, or expanded storage pods can be integrated seamlessly
