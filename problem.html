                <p>
                    During a three-year mission, an eight-person crew would accumulate over
                    12 thousand kg of inorganic waste, or trash, which is a huge problem. If
                    the issue is not addressed as soon as possible, we humans might cause
                    some permanent damage to the environment on Mars.
