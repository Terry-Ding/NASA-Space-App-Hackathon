\subsection{Goal}
Find an efficient and reliable way to recycle and reuse the waste on Mars.

\section{Our Solution: Mars Habitat Recycling-to-Manufacturing System (MHRMS)}

\subsection{System Overview}
\textbf{Purpose:} Convert waste materials from Mars habitat operations into usable 3D printing filament and manufacturing feedstock, with emphasis on CO2 extraction byproducts.

\textbf{Design Philosophy:} Modular, relocatable, powered by habitat grid, zero-waste discharge

\textbf{Total System Mass:} $\sim$720 kg (disassembled into $<$100 kg components)

\subsection{Mars Environment Context}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases, with temperatures ranging from 70°F (20°C) to -225°F (-153°C)
    \item Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by meteorites and the thin atmosphere causes heat from the Sun to easily escape
    \item Dust storms can cover much of the planet, sometimes taking months for all dust to settle
    \item Mars completes one rotation every 24.6 hours (a "sol"), with a year lasting 687 Earth days
    \item These conditions directly impact recycling system design: thermal management is critical, dust mitigation essential
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Critical Mars-Specific Design Considerations}

\subsubsection{Waste Behavior in Mars Environment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vacuum Exposure Challenges:} Based on NASA Glenn Research Center analysis of waste behavior when exposed to vacuum
    \item \textbf{Water Sublimation:} When waste is exposed to Mars' near-vacuum conditions (0.6\% Earth pressure), approximately 20\% of water content will sublimate before the waste completely freezes. This process takes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Small items (3mm droplets): $\sim$7 seconds to freeze
        \item Standard waste "football" (20cm compressed bundle): $\sim$3.4 hours to freeze
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Implications for Recycling System:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Pre-processing must handle both frozen and partially sublimated materials
        \item Vapor capture systems required to prevent water loss during initial processing
        \item Grinding chambers must be sealed to capture sublimating volatiles
        \item Temperature control critical: waste arriving at facility may be frozen solid (-153°C from overnight exposure)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Thermal Management on Mars}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Mars temperature swings from 70°F (20°C) to -225°F (-153°C)
    \item \textbf{Solutions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Insulated processing chambers: Maintain optimal processing temperatures (150-1400°C depending on module)
        \item Pre-heating systems: Thaw frozen waste before processing
        \item Waste heat recovery: Capture heat from processing for habitat use
        \item Phase-change thermal buffers: Smooth out temperature fluctuations
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mars Sol Adaptation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mars Day:} 24.6 hours (24h 39m) vs Earth's 24 hours
    \item \textbf{Operational Impact:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Processing schedules calibrated to Mars sols
        \item Automation advantage: rovers and processing continue during crew sleep cycles
        \item Benefit: Extra 39 minutes per sol allows for extended processing cycles
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{NASA Data Reference}
Based on ISS and shuttle waste studies, daily waste generation averages 1.45 kg per crew member, including 0.160 kg clothing, 0.352 kg food/packaging, 0.449 kg human waste, and other consumables. For a 4-person crew on a 180-day mission, this totals approximately 1,046 kg of recyclable waste.

\subsection{Sorting Protocol}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual inspection - crew separates by visual category
    \item Magnetic separation - ferrous vs non-ferrous metals
    \item Density sorting - polymer type identification
    \item Quality control - contamination check, damage assessment
    \item Storage: Separate sealed containers for each category in airlock staging area
\end{itemize}

\section{Alternative Waste Processing Options}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Option A -- Direct Venting to Space (NOT RECOMMENDED)}
    
    NASA Glenn Research Center evaluated simply disposing waste via airlock to space. Key findings:
    
    \textbf{Technical Challenges:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Time-intensive: Using existing airlock technology (3-hour depressurization cycle), disposing of waste from a 180-day, 4-person mission would require 1,250-2,500 hours of crew time
        \item Hazard: 20\% of water content sublimates and can re-condense on spacecraft surfaces or contaminate equipment
        \item Trajectory risk: Low-velocity disposal at L2 libration points risks waste re-impacting spacecraft
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Conclusion:} Direct disposal to space is impractical and hazardous for Mars missions

    \item \textbf{Option B: Partial Processing to Mixed Gases}
    
    NASA's "Trash-to-Gas" (TtG) Approach: Process waste in primary reactor only, producing mixed gases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 10\% H$_2$, 22\% CO, 68\% CO$_2$
        \item Can be used in resistojet thrusters (134.3 sec Isp)
        \item Requires 0.28 kg/crew-day makeup water
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Benefits:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simpler system (fewer processing steps)
        \item Can provide station-keeping propulsion
        \item Lower energy requirements
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Limitations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lower-quality propellant (vs. pure O$_2$/CH$_4$)
        \item Still requires makeup water
        \item Limited manufacturing applications
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Option C: Full Processing to High-Quality Propellants (RECOMMENDED)}
    
    NASA's "Trash-to-Supply Gas" (TtSG) - Our Baseline: Complete processing through secondary reactors:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 59\% O$_2$, 41\% CH$_4$ (optimal rocket propellant)
        \item Can achieve 250+ sec Isp in rocket engines
        \item Enables both propulsion AND manufacturing uses
        \item Requires 0.15 kg/crew-day makeup water (less than TtG)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Our Enhanced System vs NASA's Approach}

\textbf{NASA TtSG (gases only):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Produces O$_2$ and CH$_4$ for propulsion
    \item Vents excess gases or stores in tanks
    \item Limited to propellant applications
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Our Integrated System (gases + solids + ISRU):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Processes waste into filament AND propellant gases
    \item Combines with regolith to create metals, glass, ceramics
    \item 3D prints replacement parts, tools, habitat components
    \item Enables true self-sufficiency vs. just propellant production
    \item Creates complete manufacturing economy
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Result:} Our system achieves everything NASA's TtSG does PLUS enables permanent settlement through manufacturing capability.
